  "new_p_110": "Welcome to the world of mortgages, the uncensored and understandable version. Join us on a fascinating journey through the complexities of the Israeli economy, where we transform complex concepts into practical knowledge that will save you a lot of money.",
  "new_p_112": "The world of mortgages is often perceived as intimidating, complex, and full of terms that are foreign to the average person. Interest rates, indices, amortization schedules, linked and unlinked tracks – all of these create great confusion among young couples and investors alike. The goal of \"Mortgage in Pajamas\" is to take this heavy subject and make it accessible in the most light, clear, and comfortable way possible – just like sitting in the living room in pajamas and chatting with a friend who understands the business.",
  "new_p_113": "In each episode, we dive deep into burning issues in the real estate and finance field. Whether you're looking for mortgage advice before purchasing your first apartment, or you're experienced investors interested in optimizing your property portfolio, this podcast was created for you. We believe that knowledge is power, and the more you know, the more informed decisions you can make that will save you hundreds of thousands of shekels over the life of your mortgage.",
  "new_p_114": "Ariel Achon brings to the table years of experience and deep familiarity with the banking system, breaking down the fine print that banks don't always want you to understand. This is not just another dry information channel, but a dynamic, current, and important conversation for every household in Israel.",
  "new_p_116": "A taste of the main topics covered in the podcast episodes",
  "new_p_118": "The process of purchasing your first home is both the most exciting and frightening. We explain the importance of mortgage advice for first-time buyers, how to build the right mix, and what are the common mistakes of young couples.",
  "new_p_120": "Is your mortgage still relevant? We discuss changing market conditions, when it's worthwhile to refinance and improve terms, and how you can shorten the loan period or reduce monthly payments.",
  "new_p_122": "For those already in the real estate game, mortgage advice for home upgraders is critical. We talk about mortgage portability, leveraging existing properties, and bridge loans.",
  "new_p_124": "Many ask me, \"Why listen to a podcast if I'm taking an advisor anyway?\". The answer is simple: a client who understands is a client who profits more. When you approach the mortgage advisory process with basic knowledge and understanding of the concepts, the dialogue becomes much more productive. The podcast allows you to familiarize yourself with the terminology, understand the various considerations, and arrive better prepared for the meeting with the bank or advisor.",
  "new_p_125": "In the various episodes of \"Mortgage in Pajamas,\" we sometimes host experts from related fields – lawyers, appraisers, and economists – to give you a complete 360-degree picture of the biggest transaction of your life. We analyze the impact of the Consumer Price Index on monthly payments, examine what happens when the prime rate rises, and explain why the lowest interest rate is not always the cheapest mortgage.",
  "new_p_130": "The podcast gives you the knowledge, we give you the solution. If you're about to purchase a home or interested in checking the feasibility of refinancing your mortgage, our office team is available for personal and tailored advice.",
  "new_p_215": "Welcome to the professional blog of Ariel Achon - Mortgage in Pajamas. Here you'll find comprehensive guides, tips and critical information on mortgage consulting, financial planning and real estate. Our goal is to make the complex financial world simple and accessible for you.",
  "new_p_217": "Taking out a mortgage is one of the biggest financial decisions of your life. In this guide, we'll break down the process into simple steps, from getting pre-approval to receiving the keys to your new home.",
  "new_p_220": "Are your mortgage terms still relevant? Find out when it's right to refinance your mortgage, how you can save tens of thousands of shekels and adjust your monthly payment to your current situation.",
  "new_p_223": "Feeling suffocated by high monthly payments? Consolidating loans into your mortgage could be the solution that gives you breathing room and enables smarter financial management.",
  "new_p_226": "Won the lottery? Congratulations! Now it's important to understand the special rules for taking out a mortgage in government projects, calculating financing percentages and the benefits you're entitled to.",
  "new_p_242": "Taking out a mortgage is probably the largest and most significant financial transaction you'll make in your lifetime. For most young couples, buying a first home is a dream come true, but the path to it is fraught with bureaucracy, complex banking terms, and fateful decisions that will affect your bank account for decades. The purpose of this guide is to organize the chaos and explain in simple language the steps on the way to your desired mortgage.",
  "new_p_244": "Before you even start looking for an apartment, you must understand your budget. Pre-approval is an official document from the bank confirming that the bank is willing to give you a loan, and for what amount. Getting approval depends on your income, previous commitments, and your credit history. Mortgage consultation at this stage is critical to understand your financing limits and prevent the heartache of signing a contract without financing capability.",
  "new_p_246": "This is the most important stage where the value of mortgage consultation for first-time buyers is measured. The bank will offer you different tracks (prime, fixed linked, variable, etc.), but the bank's interest is to maximize its profits. Our job is to build a portfolio for you that spreads risks, saves on interest costs, and is tailored to your monthly repayment capacity and your family's future plans (such as expanding the family or study funds expected to be released).",
  "new_p_248": "After we have a desired portfolio, we go out to tender interest rates with different banks. This is where an experienced mortgage advisor can save you tens and even hundreds of thousands of shekels. Banks compete for good clients, and professional knowledge allows for pressing interest rates downward much more effectively than a private individual coming to a branch.",
  "new_p_250": "After choosing the winning bank, the bureaucracy stage begins: property appraisals, life and building insurance, registering warning notices and mortgages. This is a technical but very important stage, where any delay can cause failure to meet payment schedules in the purchase contract. Professional guidance ensures all documents are submitted correctly and quickly.",
  "new_p_251": "Remember: A mortgage is a complex financial product. Don't deal with it alone. Professional mortgage consultation is an investment that pays for itself many times over in long-term savings and peace of mind throughout the entire process.",
  "new_p_268": "Many tend to think that a mortgage is a \"Catholic wedding\" for 25 or 30 years, and that once we've signed - that's it. But the truth is that a mortgage is a dynamic product. The market changes, interest rates in the economy rise and fall, and your personal situation also changes (promotion at work, inheritance, or heaven forbid a decrease in income). Mortgage refinancing and terms improvement is a powerful financial tool that allows you to open your existing mortgage and rebuild it under better terms.",
  "new_p_270": "Mortgage refinancing is a process where we take a new mortgage to pay off the old mortgage. The goal is almost always one of two things: either to reduce the monthly payment to ease the current financial burden, or to shorten the mortgage period to save on accumulated interest payments and finish with the debt faster. Often, through proper mortgage consultation, it's possible to achieve both goals together.",
  "new_p_272": "There are several junctures where you must check your mortgage:\n\n1. Change in economy interest rates: If you took a mortgage during a period of high interest rates and now rates have dropped, there's potential for huge savings.\n\n2. Change in financial status: If your income has increased, consider increasing the monthly payment and shortening the years. This will save you a lot of money.\n\n3. Receiving a lump sum: A released study fund or inheritance can be used to pay off part of the mortgage as part of refinancing.\n\n4. Difficulty with monthly payments: If you're facing cash flow difficulties, refinancing can redistribute the loan and reduce the monthly payment.",
  "new_p_274": "One of the important things in checking refinancing feasibility is the early repayment fee (exit penalty). Sometimes the interest savings are large, but the penalty makes the move unprofitable. A mortgage advisor for housing improvers and refinancers will perform an accurate calculation for you including all associated fees, to ensure you're actually saving net money and not just \"on paper\".",
  "new_p_275": "Warm recommendation: Don't let your mortgage \"sleep\" for long years without checking. A feasibility check for refinancing once every year or two could be worth a lot of money to you. Contact us for a professional check without obligation.",
  "new_p_292": "Many families in Israel find themselves in a financial trap: they have a mortgage, and over the years have added a car loan, renovation loan, overdraft coverage loan, and other credit card obligations. The result is a monthly payment that strangles the family and prevents them from managing normally. The solution of loan consolidation through mortgage (all-purpose loan) is one of the most effective tools for getting out of financial trouble.",
  "new_p_294": "The idea is simple: commercial (regular) loans are usually given for short periods of 3-5 years at relatively high interest rates. In contrast, a mortgage can be spread over 20 or 30 years, and the interest rates are (usually) lower because the bank has strong collateral (the property). In the loan consolidation process, we take an addition to the existing mortgage against the property, and use this money to close all the small and expensive loans.",
  "new_p_296": "The effect is immediate and dramatic. A family that was paying 4,000 NIS on a mortgage plus another 5,000 NIS on various loans (total 9,000 NIS), can after loan consolidation find themselves with a total monthly payment of only 5,500 NIS. This difference – 3,500 NIS that remains net each month – is the oxygen that allows the family to return to balance and live with dignity.",
  "new_p_298": "Loan consolidation is suitable for those who own real estate property, and whose current mortgage value is less than 50% of the property value (usually it's possible to reach up to 50% financing for debt closure, and sometimes even more with non-bank solutions). It's very important to perform this move with professional mortgage consultation, to ensure you don't endanger the property and to build a recovery plan that will prevent you from returning to the same debts in the future.",
  "new_p_300": "It's important to remember that spreading the debt over many years increases the total interest you'll pay at the end of the period. Therefore, loan consolidation is a solution designed to solve a current cash flow problem ('firefighting'). If you can handle the current payments, we won't always recommend this move. But if you're in chronic overdraft and struggling to make ends meet, this is a real lifeline.",
  "new_p_301": "Under financial pressure? Don't wait for the bank to start bouncing checks. Contact us today to check feasibility for loan consolidation and starting a new path.",
  "new_p_318": "Winning the \"Discounted Apartment\" lottery (formerly Buyer's Price) is a joyful event that can save you hundreds of thousands of shekels when purchasing your first apartment. However, taking a mortgage in these projects is fundamentally different from buying an apartment in the free market. There are unique rules designed to make it easier for you, but also complex bureaucracy that's important to know to avoid losing eligibility or making costly mistakes.",
  "new_p_320": "The biggest advantage in a mortgage for a discounted apartment is how banks calculate the property value. While in the free market the bank provides financing according to the contract price, in these projects the bank may give you a mortgage according to the real market value of the apartment (as determined by an appraiser), not according to the discounted price at which you purchased it. The meaning: you can get a very high financing percentage relative to the purchase price, thus requiring significantly lower equity (minimum 100,000 NIS or 10%, whichever is higher).",
  "new_p_322": "Unlike a second-hand apartment where you pay and receive keys, here we're talking about purchasing \"on paper\". Payments to the contractor are linked to the construction input index, which can make the apartment more expensive by tens of thousands of shekels throughout the construction period. Mortgage consultation for first apartments in these projects focuses on building a smart payment strategy – should you advance payments to the contractor to save on the index? And when to start paying the mortgage (grace period)?",
  "new_p_324": "Despite the benefits, there are difficulties: banks sometimes harden their positions on interest rates for Buyer's Price winners, and the process with contractors can be slow and exhausting. Additionally, there's a prohibition on selling the apartment for several years (usually 5 years from receiving Form 4 or 7 years from winning), which requires long-term planning.",
  "new_p_326": "The complexity of calculating financing percentages, dealing with appraisers, and the need to maneuver between current rent payments and future mortgage payments requires a guiding hand. We're here to ensure you take advantage of all the benefits you're entitled to and that you won't be surprised by unexpected costs on the way to your apartment.",

In this article, we'll review the main pitfalls and how professional mortgage consulting can save you from them.",
  "new_p_363": "Most people take out a mortgage once or twice in their lifetime. In contrast, banks conduct such transactions thousands of times a day. These knowledge gaps create a situation where borrowers approach the deal from a distinctly disadvantaged position. Without objective mortgage consulting, it's very easy to fall into marketing traps that seem attractive in the short term but are destructive in the long run.",
  "new_p_364": "Many think a mortgage is a uniform off-the-shelf product, but in reality it's a \"suit\" that needs to be tailored precisely to your measurements. When we approach the process of first-time home buyer mortgage consulting, we repeatedly encounter the same basic errors that keep repeating themselves. Here's the complete list of mistakes you should know before signing at the bank.",
  "new_p_367": "This is the most common mistake. Many borrowers chase the lowest interest rate without understanding the implications of indexation tracks. A low initial interest rate in an index-linked track may prove very expensive down the road when the principal inflates and monthly payments skyrocket. The right mix is more important than a specific interest rate.",
  "new_p_369": "\"I've been with this bank since age 16, they'll surely give me a good deal.\" Wrong! The bank is a business whose goal is to maximize profits. A captive customer is the ideal customer for the bank. You must conduct a comprehensive market survey among all banks and negotiate. Often, a competing bank will offer significantly better terms to recruit you as new customers.",
  "new_p_371": "Mortgages are taken for 20 or 30 years. Will your income and expenses remain the same? Family expansion, education expenses, or career changes must be taken into account. Proper planning must include \"exit points\" and flexibility for changes, an option sometimes forgotten when refinancing and improving terms or taking a new mortgage.",
  "new_p_373": "Life insurance, property insurance, file opening fees, appraisals, attorney fees... all of these add up to significant amounts. Sometimes the monthly payment seems reasonable, but with the addition of insurance it becomes financially strangling. It's important to calculate the \"total monthly payment\" and not just the payment to the bank.",
  "new_p_375": "Relying on the bank clerk as an advisor is an inherent conflict of interest. The bank clerk looks out for the bank, a private mortgage consultant looks out for you. The savings achieved through building the right mix and professional negotiation exceed the cost of the consulting itself by tens of times.",
  "new_p_377": "The secret to a good mortgage is balance. Balance between stable tracks (fixed interest) and cheap but volatile tracks (prime), and balance between current monthly payments and future repayment capacity.",
  "new_p_378": "When we at Ariel Achon provide mortgage consulting, we first build a financial profile of the client. We check not only how much you earn today, but what your plans are for the future. Is a sum of money expected to be released (continuing education fund)? Are you planning to change apartments in 5 years? These questions are critical for choosing the right tracks.",
  "new_p_383": "Whether you're facing your first home purchase or considering mortgage refinancing, professional evaluation can save you heartache and significant money. Our team is here to ensure you're making the right move.",
  "new_p_417": "One of the critical stages in any mortgage consulting process is building the mix. Understanding the different tracks, the advantages and disadvantages of each, is the key to building a stable and economical loan for years to come.",
  "new_p_419": "When we approach taking a mortgage, the bank doesn't offer us a single loan, but rather a combination of several smaller loans, each called a \"track\". Each track has different characteristics: the type of interest (fixed or variable), indexation (to the Consumer Price Index or non-indexed), and exit stations (the option for early repayment without penalty).",
  "new_p_420": "As part of a professional mortgage consulting process, our goal is to build the \"mix\" – the precise combination between the different tracks – that will suit your financial profile. A proper mix balances risk and opportunity, between monthly payment stability and overall interest savings throughout the life of the loan.",
  "new_p_421": "Many mistakenly think that the lowest interest rate is the most important. This is a common mistake. A track with a low initial interest rate can be very dangerous if it's exposed to extreme changes in the index or Bank of Israel interest rate. Therefore, a deep understanding of the tracks is critical.",
  "new_p_423": "A review of the common mortgage tracks and what each means for your monthly payment",
  "new_p_425": "A track that is not indexed to the CPI, based on the Bank of Israel interest rate plus a fixed margin (1.5%). This is a track that was once very cheap, but today is directly affected by interest rate increases in the economy.",

  "new_p_437": "A subsidized loan granted to eligible applicants according to state criteria. Usually involves a fixed interest rate linked to the index under preferential terms.",
  "new_p_441": "There is no single \"mortgage mix\" that suits everyone. A young couple purchasing their first apartment and needing maximum security will receive completely different recommendations than an experienced investor planning to sell the property within a few years.",
  "new_p_442": "When we provide mortgage consulting services for first-time buyers, we take into account parameters such as future repayment capacity, expected family growth, and study funds expected to be released. In contrast, when advising home upgraders, the emphasis may be on flexibility and future mortgage recycling.",
  "new_p_443": "The wisdom is to balance: combine a \"fixed CPI-linked\" track for stability, together with a \"prime\" track for flexibility, and perhaps a small portion in a variable track if early repayment is expected. This is the heart of proper financial planning.",

  "new_p_487": "Housing upgraders are a unique group in the real estate world. Unlike first-time buyers, you already have a property in hand, and often an existing mortgage as well. This situation creates a complex equation of timing and finances: Should you sell first and then buy? Or perhaps find your dream apartment and only then put your current apartment up for sale?",
  "new_p_488": "This is exactly where the value of professional mortgage consulting comes into play. While first-time home mortgages focus on building a portfolio and interest rates, housing upgraders require broad strategic vision that includes bridging solutions, mortgage transfers, and proper tax planning. A mistake in timing or calculating financial capacity could cost tens of thousands of shekels or even more.",
  "new_p_490": "Each decision has financial and bureaucratic implications that are important to understand before setting out on the journey.",
  "new_p_492": "You've found your dream apartment and don't want to miss out on it. The advantage is certainty about the new home, but the risk is a large financial commitment before receiving the money from the old apartment.",
  "new_p_497": "The financially safer route. You know exactly how much money is available to you. The downside is the need to find an apartment under time pressure or rent an apartment for an interim period.",
  "new_p_502": "In the process of mortgage consultation for housing upgraders, we examine a variety of financial tools that can facilitate the transition and save costs:",
  "new_p_504": "If you have an existing mortgage with excellent terms (for example, low interest rates from the past), you don't have to pay it off. You can \"transfer\" it to the new property and maintain the good terms, while covering the difference with a new mortgage. This is a move that can save tens of thousands of shekels compared to taking a completely new mortgage.",
  "new_p_506": "A classic solution for situations where you bought before you sold. The bank provides you with a loan against the existing or new apartment, where you pay only the interest (or don't pay at all) for a period of up to two years. The principal is repaid in one lump sum upon selling the old apartment.",
  "new_p_508": "The transition is an excellent opportunity to re-examine the loan terms. Sometimes it's more profitable to pay off the old mortgage and take a new one with terms adapted to the current market situation and your updated repayment capacity.",

  "new_p_558": "Purchasing an investment property is fundamentally different from buying a home for residence, both in terms of financial objectives and banking regulations. While for a first home you can receive up to 75% financing, the Bank of Israel limits the financing percentage for a second property (investment property) to only 50% of the property value. This restriction requires investors to come with significantly more equity capital or find creative financing solutions.",
  "new_p_559": "When we approach mortgage consulting for investors, the main goal is not necessarily to \"finish with the mortgage as quickly as possible,\" but to maximize return on investment (ROI). Sometimes, a longer mortgage with lower monthly payments will allow the rental income to fully cover the loan, thereby creating an asset that finances itself (\"income-generating asset\").",
  "new_p_561": "One of the biggest challenges for investors is raising the required equity capital (50% of the purchased property value). This is where a powerful tool that many are unaware of comes into play: leveraging an existing property. If you own a residential property and the mortgage on it is less than 50% of its value (or there's no mortgage on it at all), you can take an additional mortgage on the existing property.",
  "new_p_566": "In the process of mortgage consulting for investors, we examine all variables to ensure the deal will be profitable and secure.",
  "new_p_569": "Will the expected rental income cover the mortgage payments? In many cases we prefer index-linked tracks with low initial payments, or \"grace\" tracks (interest-only payments) for a certain period, to ensure the property doesn't become a monthly burden on your bank account.",
  "new_p_572": "Purchasing a second apartment requires payment of purchase tax (from the first shekel). This is a significant amount that must be taken into account in the overall calculation of transaction costs and the required mortgage amount. Improper planning of purchase tax can turn a good deal into a losing transaction.",
  "new_p_575": "Many investors plan to sell the property (\"exit\") after several years. Therefore, it's critical to build a mortgage portfolio that allows early repayment without high exit penalties. The right combination of prime tracks and variable tracks is key to this flexibility.",
  "new_p_577": "Banks view investors as a different type of client. The risks and opportunities are different from those of single apartment buyers. An expert mortgage consultant who understands the investment world will know how to build your financial portfolio in a way that serves your interests, not the bank's.",
  "new_p_578": "The consultation process includes an in-depth analysis of financial capabilities, building a financing strategy tailored to the nature of the investment (long-term or short-term), and conducting tough negotiations with banks to achieve the best interest rates. Saving tenths of a percent in interest can accumulate to savings of tens or even hundreds of thousands of shekels over the life of the loan, dramatically improving your net return.",

  "new_p_623": "When applying for a first home mortgage, the state and banks offer unique terms designed to assist young couples and first-time buyers. The main and most significant difference is in the financing percentages: first-time home buyers (for their only residence) are eligible to receive financing of up to 75% of the property value from the bank. This means you only need to bring 25% of the home's value as a down payment.",
  "new_p_624": "However, the major challenge isn't just raising the down payment, but properly planning the monthly repayments over time. This is where the critical need for professional mortgage consultation comes into play, knowing how to build a mix tailored to your current and future repayment capabilities, while considering expected changes in the household such as family expansion or career changes.",
  "new_p_627": "Before signing a purchase agreement, you must obtain a \"preliminary approval\" from the bank. The process of first home mortgage consultation begins with a thorough examination of your income, expenses, and obligations to understand what real budget is available to you.",

  "new_p_631": "An integral part of the process is purchasing life insurance and property insurance. These costs are added to the monthly repayment and must be taken into account when calculating the repayment ratio from your available income.",
  "new_p_633": "Many ask themselves whether it's worth paying a private consultant when the bank offers its own advisor. The answer lies in interests: the bank's advisor works for the bank and is committed to its profitability. In contrast, a private consultant providing objective mortgage consultation is committed solely to your personal benefit.",
  "new_p_634": "In the process of first-time home mortgage consultation, the potential savings can reach tens or even hundreds of thousands of shekels over the life of the mortgage.

In the process of mortgage consulting, we emphasize not only the interest rates and tracks, but also the accompanying expenses that will stay with you for years.",
  "new_p_651": "When the bank grants you a mortgage loan, it takes a significant risk. To protect its money, the bank requires two types of insurance as a condition for receiving the funds: life insurance and structure insurance. Together, they are called 'mortgage insurance'.

  "new_p_652": "As part of first-time home mortgage consulting, many young couples are surprised to discover that the monthly payment isn't just comprised of principal and interest, but also includes a monthly insurance payment that can reach hundreds of shekels. A deep understanding of insurance components can save you thousands of shekels over the life of the mortgage.",
  "new_p_655": "The purpose of life insurance is to ensure that in case of the death of one of the borrowers, God forbid, the insurance company will pay the bank the remaining mortgage balance. This prevents a situation where the surviving spouse or heirs are left with a heavy debt they cannot handle, and might lose the home.",
  "new_p_660": "Structure insurance is designed to cover physical damage to the property itself, such as fire, earthquake, pipe explosion and natural disasters. The bank requires this insurance to ensure that its collateral (the apartment) doesn't lose its value in case of disaster.",
  "new_p_665": "One of the common questions in the mortgage consulting process is where to purchase the insurance. Banks offer mortgage insurance through agencies affiliated with them, and sometimes this seems like the most convenient solution – 'everything in one place'. However, this convenience sometimes has a price.",
  "new_p_666": "Purchasing insurance through a private insurance agent or directly from insurance companies may be significantly cheaper. Additionally, private policies may include better extensions and coverage (such as third-party coverage in structure insurance) that aren't always included in the bank's basic policy.",

  "new_p_672": "Fill out the health declaration seriously. Hiding information could lead to claim rejection at the moment of truth. If your health condition has improved (for example, you stopped smoking), update the policy to reduce the premium.",
  "new_p_674": "Just like performing mortgage refinancing and improving interest rate conditions, it's recommended to check your insurance portfolio once every few years. Insurance rates change and new discounts emerge in the market.",

  "new_p_752": "When young couples or home upgraders approach the process of buying a home, the main focus is usually on the property price itself and the required mortgage amount. This is a common mistake that can lead to a significant budget shortfall. In practice, the additional transaction expenses can reach tens or even hundreds of thousands of shekels, often adding 5% to 10% to the original home price.",
  "new_p_753": "In the mortgage consulting process, one of the critical steps is building a complete financial profile of the client. An experienced mortgage advisor doesn't just look at monthly repayment capacity, but examines the real equity remaining to the client after deducting all additional expenses. Ignoring these expenses can lead to a situation where you don't have enough equity to sign the contract or make the first payment to the contractor.",
  "new_p_755": "Here's a breakdown of the main costs you'll encounter on your way to homeownership, beyond the property price itself:",
  "new_p_757": "An attorney accompanies the transaction from start to finish, including property inspection, contract drafting, and land registry registration. The standard fee usually ranges between 0.5% to 1.5% of the property value plus VAT. When purchasing from a contractor, the law limits the contractor's attorney fee to a fixed amount (about 5,000 NIS plus VAT), but you'll still need your own attorney.",
  "new_p_759": "The bank requires an appraiser's evaluation to ensure the property value matches the mortgage amount. The cost of an appraiser from the bank's list usually ranges between 600 to 1,000 NIS for a standard property. If you decide to bring a private appraiser before signing the contract (highly recommended!), the cost may be higher, but it can save you from purchasing a problematic property.",
  "new_p_761": "If you used a broker to find the property, the standard cost is 2% of the property price plus VAT. This is a very significant expense to factor into your equity calculation, as the bank doesn't finance brokerage fees as part of the mortgage.",
  "new_p_763": "The tax amount depends on the property value and your status (single home, home upgraders, or investors). For a first home, there's an exemption up to a certain ceiling, but above it you pay graduated tax. It's important to check the current tax brackets with the Tax Authority before purchase.",
  "new_p_765": "Opening a mortgage file costs 0.25% of the loan amount (negotiable). Additionally, you must factor in the costs of life insurance and building insurance, which are mandatory conditions for obtaining the mortgage. These costs are paid monthly throughout the life of the loan.",
  "new_p_767": "When purchasing an off-plan property from a contractor, the remaining unpaid balance is linked to the construction input index. Increases in this index can add tens of thousands of shekels to the final property price until you receive the keys. With proper mortgage consulting, you can plan the payment schedule to minimize this exposure.",
  "new_p_769": "Many think a mortgage advisor only deals with interest rates with the bank, but their role is much broader. An essential part of the mortgage consulting process is building a comprehensive financial plan that takes into account all the components we mentioned above.",
  "new_p_770": "When we build a mortgage mix, we ensure you have enough liquidity to pay all additional expenses without going into bank overdrafts or taking expensive last-minute loans. Proper planning can include advancing payments to the contractor to prevent index increases, negotiating file opening fees, and adjusting monthly repayments to allow you to maintain a decent standard of living even after moving to the new home.",
  "new_p_771": "Additionally, a professional advisor will know how to refer you to reliable professionals (appraisers, attorneys, insurance agents) who will provide you with quality service at fair prices, which can save you thousands of additional shekels along the way.",
  "new_p_773": "Don't let additional expenses surprise you. Let's build a smart mortgage plan that takes the full picture into account and saves you money.",
  "new_p_798": "Your property is worth a lot of money, and you don't have to sell it to benefit from it. A reverse mortgage allows people aged 60 and above to receive money in exchange for a lien on their home, without monthly repayments and without giving up ownership.",
  "new_p_801": "A reverse mortgage is a unique financial product designed for the senior population (usually aged 60 and above). The concept behind the product is simple: many people at retirement age own real estate property outright, but often experience a decline in their regular monthly income or need a significant amount of money for various needs.",
  "new_p_802": "Unlike a regular mortgage, where borrowers make monthly payments to the bank to purchase the property, in a reverse mortgage the bank or insurance company provides borrowers with a sum of money (as a lump sum or monthly allowance) against a lien on the existing property. The major advantage is that in most tracks there is no need for regular monthly repayment. The loan is repaid only when the borrowers leave the house, sell it, or pass away (and then the heirs repay the debt or sell the property).",
  "new_p_803": "This process requires deep understanding and proper financial planning. This is where the need for professional mortgage consulting services comes into play, which will help you understand the terms, interest rates and long-term implications on inheritance and property value.",
  "new_p_806": "Many parents want to help their children with the down payment for a mortgage for their first home. A reverse mortgage allows releasing money from the existing property and giving it to the children as a gift, without affecting the parents' monthly cash flow.",
  "new_p_809": "In senior years, medical expenses or the need for assisted living may increase significantly. The money received can be used to finance treatments, a personal caregiver or moving to premium assisted living, while maintaining a high standard of living.",
  "new_p_812": "Want to take a trip around the world? Renovate the house? Or simply live with greater comfort? A reverse mortgage allows supplementing pension income and enjoying life without unnecessary financial worries.",
  "new_p_814": "The loan amount that can be received is determined by the age of the youngest borrower (the older the age, the higher the financing percentage) and the property value. Usually you can receive between 15% to 50% of the home's value.",
  "new_p_815": "There are several main tracks:",
  "new_p_819": "It's important to remember that the interest rate on a reverse mortgage is usually higher than a regular residential mortgage, so mortgage consulting is critical for understanding the total costs and comparing between different entities offering the product.",
  "new_p_821": "\"Before signing a reverse mortgage, involve the children in the decision. Since the loan will ultimately affect the inheritance, family transparency prevents future conflicts and allows everyone to understand the benefits of the process.\"",
  "new_p_823": "Don't do it alone. We will accompany you through the process, compare the different offers from insurance companies and banks for you, and ensure you get the best terms for you and your family.",
  "new_p_849": "Business owners and self-employed individuals face unique challenges on their path to their dream home. While employees present pay stubs, you need to prove business stability over time. The following guide will help you organize the process and explain why personalized mortgage consulting is critical for you.",
  "new_p_851": "For the bank, the keyword is \"stability.\" When an employee applies for a mortgage, the bank sees a clear and predictable income stream. In contrast, with self-employed individuals, income may vary from month to month, and the business is exposed to various risks that don't exist with employees.",
  "new_p_852": "Banks are concerned about situations of declining business income, business closure, or seasonal volatility. Therefore, the review process for self-employed individuals is much more thorough and includes analysis of financial statements from several years back. This is exactly where the value of professional mortgage consulting comes into play – the ability to present the bank with the complete and accurate picture of your business, beyond the dry numbers in the tax assessment.",
  "new_p_855": "Unlike employees where the bank looks at their gross income (with certain deductions), for self-employed individuals the bank looks at net profit after expenses and before tax. The bank examines annual tax assessments (Form 1301) from the last two or three years to derive a monthly average.",
  "new_p_857": "An important point that many miss: an experienced mortgage advisor will know to ask the bank to add back to the income non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, or one-time financing expenses. This action can significantly increase the recognized income for calculating the repayment ratio.",
  "new_p_859": "In addition to tax assessments, the bank will require a CPA confirmation of current year income. If there's a large gap between the current year and previous years, you'll need to provide convincing explanations. Early preparation of the file is critical in such cases.",
  "new_p_861": "To receive preliminary mortgage approval, you'll need to prepare an organized file. Unlike employees who only need 3 pay stubs, your list is longer:",
  "new_p_867": "Golden tip: Make sure there are no bounced checks or standing orders in the business and personal accounts in the months before submitting the application. Such a \"stain\" could disqualify the application or significantly increase interest rates.",
  "new_p_869": "The mortgage process for self-employed individuals is more complex and requires specific expertise. The bank clerk sees the dry data in the system and often doesn't understand the business potential or the reasons for income volatility. An experienced mortgage advisor knows how to \"translate\" business language into banking language.",
  "new_p_870": "Whether it's an application for first-time home buyer mortgage consulting or for those upgrading their housing, professional guidance includes building a financial profile that presents the business in the best possible light. We know how to deal with low assessments in certain years, explain one-time expenses, and build a mortgage mix that's tailored to your business cash flow.",
  "new_p_872": "Don't let bureaucracy stop you. We're here to help you get the best mortgage, with terms that suit your business and family.",
  "new_p_899": "Moving homes but don't want to give up the excellent interest rates you have on your current mortgage? Mortgage transfer is the solution for you. In this guide, we'll explain exactly how to execute the process, in which cases it's worthwhile, and how to avoid costly mistakes.",
  "new_p_902": "In the field of mortgage consulting, one of the most important concepts for home upgraders is \"mortgage transfer.\" Simply put, this is a process where you transfer your existing mortgage loan from the old property (which you're selling) to the new property (which you're buying), while maintaining the original loan terms.",
  "new_p_903": "During periods when market interest rates rise, your old mortgage becomes a financial asset in itself. If you took out a mortgage several years ago at near-zero interest rates, paying it off and taking a new mortgage under current market conditions could cost you hundreds of thousands of shekels over the life of the loan. Mortgage transfer allows you to \"drag\" the good terms, margins, and interest rates to your next property.",
  "new_p_906": "The main reason for performing a transfer. If the interest rates on your current mortgage are significantly lower than the rates currently offered in the market, a transfer will save you substantial money on monthly and total interest payments.",
  "new_p_908": "In certain tracks, early repayment of the mortgage involves an early repayment fee (penalty) that can reach tens of thousands of shekels. Mortgage transfer prevents this taxable event and saves the penalty.",
  "new_p_910": "Sometimes the old mortgage includes special benefits, cheaper mortgage insurance, or indexation terms that no longer exist in the market. Transfer allows you to preserve the entire loan \"package.\"",
  "new_p_912": "The transfer process can be executed in three main ways, depending on the timing of selling the old apartment and purchasing the new one. As part of mortgage consulting for home upgraders, we match the right route to your specific situation:",
  "new_p_914": "The ideal but most complex situation to execute. The mortgage transfer is performed on one day when you sell the old apartment and buy the new one. The money from your buyer goes directly to the seller of the new apartment, and the lien is exchanged. Requires perfect coordination between all parties.",
  "new_p_916": "If you've already sold the old apartment but haven't yet purchased a new one, the bank allows you to \"freeze\" the mortgage. The money from the sale is deposited in the bank as collateral against the mortgage, until you find a new property and mortgage it. This is an excellent way not to lose the terms during the interim period.",
  "new_p_918": "The most common case among home upgraders. You've purchased a new apartment from a contractor or second-hand, but haven't yet sold the old one. In this case, you can transfer the mortgage to the new property even before removing the lien from the old one, usually through the use of a bridge loan or temporary bank guarantee.",
  "new_p_920": "Mortgage transfer isn't always the right move. Sometimes, mortgage refinancing and improving terms might be more worthwhile, even if interest rates have risen. When does this happen? When your original mortgage mix isn't optimal, or when your financial needs have changed fundamentally.",
  "new_p_921": "For example, if your original mortgage is index-linked and the index has risen significantly, the principal may not have decreased as you expected. In such a case, building a new and more stable mix (even at a higher nominal interest rate) might be a smarter long-term move. Additionally, sometimes banks create bureaucratic difficulties for transfers to encourage customers to take a new loan at higher interest rates.",
  "new_p_923": "Even if you've decided to transfer the mortgage, you'll likely need to add additional money (\"mortgage supplement\") for the new and more expensive apartment. The bank will price this supplement according to current market interest rates. This is exactly where a mortgage advisor can negotiate for you and secure better terms on the new portion, while preserving the old portion.",
  "new_p_926": "Analysis of the existing portfolio against new market offers to ensure that transfer is indeed the most profitable step.",
  "new_p_928": "Obtaining approval from the bank for the mortgage transfer and for the additional amount required (if needed).",
  "new_p_930": "Conducting an appraisal of the new property to ensure it can serve as adequate collateral for the mortgage.",
  "new_p_932": "Signing the transfer documents, updating insurance policies, and transferring the funds.",
  "new_p_934": "The mortgage transfer process requires expertise and precision to maximize savings. Ariel Achon's team is here to guide you through a safe, professional, and profitable process.",
  "new_p_961": "A mortgage is the largest financial transaction you'll make in your lifetime. The difference between taking a mortgage on your own versus professional guidance can amount to savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years.",
  "new_p_964": "Many mistakenly believe that the bank's mortgage officer is there to advise them and find the best track for them. This is a common mistake that can be very costly. It's important to understand: the bank officer, however skilled and nice, is first and foremost a bank employee. Their clear interest is to maximize the bank's profits from your loan. In contrast, private and objective mortgage consulting puts you at the center.",
  "new_p_965": "When you hire a private mortgage consultant, you're essentially hiring a professional who represents only your financial interests. Their goal is singular: to build you a smart, stable, and economical mortgage portfolio that's precisely tailored to your repayment capacity and your family's future plans.",
  "new_p_979": "The most prominent advantage is financial savings. Through building the right portfolio (not necessarily what the bank offers by default) and conducting aggressive interest rate tenders with different banks, you can save tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars over the mortgage's lifetime. A good consultant knows where banks are more flexible and where you can push for improved terms.",
  "new_p_981": "The mortgage process involves tons of bureaucracy, forms, approvals, and running between bank branches. We take on the bureaucratic handling, submit applications in an organized and professional manner, and save you precious vacation days and unnecessary headaches. You only come to the bank for final signatures.",
  "new_p_983": "Every family is a world unto itself with different needs. Are you planning to expand the family? Is a sum of money expected to be released in a few years? We build a portfolio that considers future changes, prevents unnecessary exit penalties, and ensures monthly payments suit your long-term capacity, so you can sleep peacefully at night.",
  "new_p_986": "For most young couples, buying a home is the most significant financial step. Lack of knowledge and understanding in this field can lead to critical mistakes that will affect the family budget for decades. First-time home buyer mortgage consultation provides you with the knowledge, confidence and close guidance, ensuring you start your life together on the right financial foot, with a sensible and tailored mortgage.",
  "new_p_987": "Home upgraders find themselves in a more complex situation, sometimes involving carrying over an existing mortgage, bridge loans, and simultaneous selling and buying. Mortgage consultation for home upgraders requires precise financial planning to bridge cash flow gaps and optimize the existing property for the benefit of the new property.",
  "new_p_989": "Market conditions are constantly changing, as is your family and financial situation. A mortgage taken several years ago may be irrelevant and expensive today. Checking the feasibility of mortgage refinancing and improving terms can save a fortune. We examine whether it's worthwhile to refinance the mortgage, shorten the term, or reduce the monthly payment, according to your current needs.",
  "new_p_991": "The cost of mortgage consultation services is negligible compared to the cumulative savings it generates. The investment in a professional consultant typically pays for itself in the first year of the mortgage and continues to bear fruit throughout the entire loan period.",
  "new_p_993": "Unfortunately, not necessarily. Sometimes captive customers actually receive less attractive offers because the bank assumes they won't leave. A mortgage consultant conducts an interest rate tender among several banks, forcing your bank to compete for you and improve terms.",
  "new_p_995": "The best time is before signing the purchase contract. This way you can know exactly what your budget is, get preliminary approval, and avoid committing to a transaction you cannot finance. However, you can approach at any stage, even after signing the contract.",
  "new_p_997": "Savings vary from case to case, but in most cases we're talking about savings of tens of thousands of shekels and sometimes even over 100,000 NIS over the life of the mortgage, resulting from choosing the right tracks, reducing index linkage, and lowering interest rates.",

  "new_p_1129": "Buying a home is probably the largest financial transaction you'll make in your lifetime. For most of us, realizing the dream of homeownership requires taking a mortgage – a long-term loan that can accompany us for 20 or even 30 years. This is exactly where mortgage consulting comes into play, which is critical to securing your financial future.",
  "new_p_1131": "Many mistakenly think that the bank clerk is their mortgage advisor. It's important to understand: the bank clerk works for the bank, and their goal is to maximize the bank's profits. In contrast, a private and objective mortgage consultant works for you, and their goal is to save you money and build a mortgage mix tailored to your repayment capacity, both now and in the future.",
  "new_p_1132": "The consulting process includes an in-depth analysis of your financial situation, understanding future needs (such as family expansion, career changes), and building a strategy for taking a loan under the most optimal terms available in the market.",
  "new_p_1134": "Before diving into deep waters, here are some concepts you must know:",
  "new_p_1139": "A mortgage mix is the combination of different interest rate tracks. There's no \"one good mortgage for everyone.\" An excellent mortgage for a young couple starting out might be a financial disaster for a family with three children and high expenses. Professional mortgage consulting focuses on building your personal mix, while spreading risks between variable and fixed tracks, and between linked and non-linked tracks.",
  "new_p_1140": "Saving a tenth of a percent in interest can accumulate to tens of thousands of shekels over the life of the mortgage. Therefore, negotiating with banks and understanding the small details are critical.",
  "new_p_1142": "For first-time home buyers, the challenge is twofold: lack of experience and great excitement that can lead to hasty decisions. The first step is getting preliminary approval from the bank, but don't settle for the first offer. Conduct a market survey, or use a consultant who will do it for you. Remember that quality mortgage consulting is an investment that pays for itself many times over in accumulated savings over the years.",
  "new_p_1149": "Buying your first home is an exciting and defining moment, but it comes with quite a few concerns. For most young couples in Israel, the path to homeownership goes through the bank for mortgages. The process may seem complex and intimidating, but with proper preparation and professional guidance from first home mortgage consulting, it can be made simpler and even save significant amounts of money over the years.",
  "new_p_1151": "Before you start looking for apartments, it's important to understand your budget. The Bank of Israel limits the financing percentage for a first home to up to 75% of the property value. This means you must bring equity from home of at least 25% of the apartment price. Additionally, you must consider associated expenses not covered by the mortgage: purchase tax (if applicable), attorney fees, brokerage fees, moving costs, and initial renovations.",
  "new_p_1152": "Professional mortgage consulting will help you map all your equity sources, including savings, parental assistance, or liquid training funds, to build the most realistic purchase budget for you.",
  "new_p_1154": "A common mistake by first-time home buyers is signing a purchase contract before receiving pre-approval from the bank. This is a dangerous mistake that could lead to contract breach and heavy penalties if the bank refuses to approve the loan. Pre-approval is an official document from the bank confirming that based on the data you presented (income, obligations, etc.), the bank is willing to provide you with a loan in a certain amount.",
  "new_p_1155": "As part of the first home mortgage consulting process, we will ensure to obtain pre-approval from several banks for you, to guarantee your financing ability and give you peace of mind in your apartment search.",
  "new_p_1157": "Young couples are usually at the beginning of their careers, with expectations of salary increases in the future, but also with expenses expected to grow (family expansion, education, etc.). A proper mortgage portfolio for a first home must consider these expected changes.",
  "new_p_1158": "For example, you can combine tracks that allow flexibility and early repayment without penalties, in case you want to upgrade your apartment in a few years. It's also important to balance between the current monthly payment and the total interest you'll pay to the bank. A monthly payment that's too low today could cause the mortgage principal to inflate and significantly increase the loan cost.",
  "new_p_1160": "Purchasing a first home is an enormous financial step. The difference between a good mortgage and a bad mortgage can amount to hundreds of thousands of shekels. Guidance from an experienced mortgage consultant will ensure you enter the deal with open eyes, with precise financial planning and with the most profitable mortgage possible to obtain.",
  "new_p_1167": "A mortgage is a long-term financial product, but our lives and market conditions are dynamic and constantly changing. What was right and economical five years ago may be expensive and unprofitable today. This is where mortgage refinancing and improving conditions comes into play. This is essentially a process where we pay off the old mortgage and take a new mortgage with better terms, adapted to the current situation.",
  "new_p_1169": "There are several main situations where it's highly recommended to perform a refinancing feasibility check:",
  "new_p_1174": "One of the main considerations in mortgage refinancing is the early repayment fee (exit penalty). Sometimes, the penalty can be high and make refinancing unprofitable. However, as part of professional mortgage consulting, we perform a precise calculation that includes the penalty cost versus the expected interest savings. In many cases, even with paying the penalty, the total savings still amounts to tens of thousands of shekels.",
  "new_p_1176": "The refinancing process is essentially similar to taking a new mortgage, but it's usually faster. There's no need to go back to the starting point of purchasing the apartment. A mortgage consultant will examine the existing portfolio, negotiate with your current bank (or other banks competing for you), and build a new and optimal portfolio.",
  "new_p_1177": "Remember: Banks won't call you to offer to reduce interest rates. The responsibility to check and save is yours. Checking refinancing feasibility is a smart financial step that every mortgage holder must perform periodically.",
  "new_p_1179": "Before you start searching for your dream home, you must understand your budget framework. The complete guide to obtaining pre-approval smartly and correctly.",
  "new_p_1182": "Mortgage pre-approval is the first official document you receive from the bank in the mortgage process. This document serves as confirmation that the bank has reviewed your basic financial data – income, obligations, and credit history – and has agreed in principle to provide you with a loan for property purchase, subject to certain conditions.",
  "new_p_1183": "It's important to understand: without pre-approval, you're essentially \"walking in the dark.\" Many couples start the process by searching for an apartment, fall in love with a property, and then discover at the moment of truth that the bank isn't willing to approve the required financing amount. In professional mortgage consulting, we always recommend obtaining approval before the first apartment viewing.",
  "new_p_1187": "Before approaching the bank, prepare the paperwork: ID cards and appendices, 3 recent pay stubs (for employees) or tax assessments and CPA confirmations (for self-employed), and bank statements from the last 3 months from all active accounts.",
  "new_p_1189": "Today you can submit a pre-approval application through bank websites or telephone centers. This is a relatively quick process that provides initial indication, but it's important to be accurate with the data entered.",
  "new_p_1191": "The approval you receive is typically valid for 3 months regarding the bank's willingness to provide credit, but note: interest rate protection is valid for only 24 days! After that, the bank may change the pricing.",
  "new_p_1193": "Receiving a pre-approval rejection is an unpleasant experience, but it's important to understand what causes it. The most common reasons include:",
  "new_p_1198": "For young couples, this process can be confusing and stressful. First-time home buyer mortgage consulting gives you a significant advantage: we analyze your financial profile before approaching the bank, identify potential pitfalls, and know how to submit the application in a way that maximizes your approval chances and the terms you'll receive.",
  "new_p_1200": "Don't face the bureaucracy alone. Let us help you achieve the best approval.",
  "new_p_1204": "The approval obligates the bank to give you the loan, but only on condition that all the data you provided is verified accurately (through documents) and that the property you choose is approved by the bank's appraiser. If discrepancies are discovered between the declaration and reality, the bank may withdraw.",
  "new_p_1206": "Absolutely. Obtaining pre-approval from multiple banks allows you to conduct an initial market survey and compare terms. However, in the final negotiation stage, it's recommended to use a mortgage advisor to manage the tender efficiently and not \"burn\" yourself with the banks.",
  "new_p_1208": "Through digital channels, you can receive initial approval within minutes to 24 hours. When dealing with a banker at a branch or through a mortgage advisor, the process may take several days, but it will usually be more accurate and tailored to your complex needs.",
  "new_p_1210": "Don't take unnecessary risks. Our team at \"Mortgage in Pajamas\" will accompany you from the pre-approval stage until you receive the keys, with confidence and peace of mind.",
  "new_p_1214": "Did you buy a new apartment from a contractor? Congratulations! But did you know that the price in the contract is not necessarily the final price you'll pay? Meet the factor that can make your apartment tens of thousands of shekels more expensive – and how to deal with it.",
  "new_p_1216": "The Construction Input Index is a statistical figure published by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) on the 15th of each month. The index reflects changes in construction costs for residential apartments and offices in Israel. It measures changes in material prices (such as concrete, iron, cement), workers' wages, mechanical engineering equipment, and more.",
  "new_p_1217": "When you purchase an apartment \"on paper\" or during construction stages from a contractor, in the vast majority of cases, the remaining payment you haven't yet paid is linked to this index. This means that if the index rises, your debt to the contractor increases accordingly. This is a mechanism designed to protect the contractor from raw material price increases, but in practice it places significant financial risk on the buyers.",
  "new_p_1221": "An annual increase of 2-3% in the Construction Input Index on a remaining debt of one million shekels means an addition of 20,000-30,000 NIS to the apartment price in just one year. Spread over 3-4 years of construction, this could amount to 100,000 NIS or more.",
  "new_p_1223": "Mortgage banks usually do not finance index additions as part of the original approved mortgage (unless prepared for this in advance). This means you will often need to bring these differences from home as additional equity at the last minute.",
  "new_p_1225": "It's important to know about the recent Sale Law amendment that came into effect, which limits indexing to only 40% of the apartment price and exempts from indexing after the contractual delivery date. An experienced mortgage advisor will know to check whether your contract meets the requirements of the new law.",
  "new_p_1227": "One of the most common questions among apartment buyers from contractors is whether it's worthwhile to advance payments to the contractor. On one hand, advancing payment \"neutralizes\" the index on the amount paid. On the other hand, to pay early, you usually need to take the mortgage earlier and start paying interest to the bank.",
  "new_p_1229": "There's no one correct answer for everyone. The decision depends on index expectations versus the interest rate level in the economy. During periods when the index rises sharply and interest rates are low, advancing payments is usually profitable. Conversely, when interest rates are high and the index is moderate, it might be better to wait.",
  "new_p_1234": "Don't let the Construction Input Index surprise you. Proper planning of the payment schedule and smart mortgage management can save you significant amounts. We're here to build the most profitable strategy for you.",
  "new_p_1269": "Before diving into loan tracks and interest rates, you need to understand the numbers. The complete guide to planning the down payment required for purchasing an apartment, and how to avoid common mistakes on the way to getting your keys.",
  "new_p_1271": "When we approach taking a mortgage, the bank looks at two main parameters: our monthly repayment capacity, and the down payment we bring to the transaction. Down payment is essentially the amount of money you pay from your own pocket for the apartment, before the bank completes the balance through the mortgage loan.",
  "new_p_1272": "As part of the mortgage consultation process, the first step is always analyzing the existing down payment. The reason for this is that the Bank of Israel has set strict rules regarding the maximum financing percentages that banks are allowed to provide. Without sufficient down payment, it's impossible to receive preliminary mortgage approval, so proper planning of financing sources is critical even before signing a purchase contract.",
  "new_p_1274": "For first-time home buyers (those without housing), the Bank of Israel allows financing of up to 75% of the property value. This means you must bring down payment of at least 25% of the apartment price.",
  "new_p_1275": "Example: For an apartment worth 2 million ₪, a down payment of 500,000 ₪ is required.",
  "new_p_1276": "Those who sell an existing apartment and buy another one in its place are entitled to financing of up to 70% of the new property value. In this case, the required down payment is 30%.",
  "new_p_1277": "There's an obligation to sell the old apartment within a specified timeframe (usually 18 months).",
  "new_p_1279": "For a second apartment and beyond (investment property), the bank may approve financing of only up to 50%. This means you must bring half of the property value from home.",
  "new_p_1280": "This is a high entry threshold that requires precise financial planning.",
  "new_p_1282": "Many ask themselves: \"Where do I get the initial money?\". This is one of the biggest challenges for young couples in Israel. As part of first-time home mortgage consultation, we map out all possible sources:",
  "new_p_1287": "A critical point that many are unaware of is that the bank calculates the financing percentage based on the lower of the two: the contract price or the appraiser's valuation.",
  "new_p_1288": "If you purchased an apartment for 2 million NIS, but the bank's appraiser valued it at only 1.8 million NIS, the bank will give you 75% of the 1.8 million. The implication? You'll have a 'gap' in your budget that you need to cover immediately from your own equity.",
  "new_p_1289": "Mortgage advisor tip: In borderline cases or in areas where prices are rising rapidly, it's recommended to conduct an 'early appraisal' before signing the contract, so you know exactly how much mortgage you can get and avoid unpleasant surprises.",
  "new_p_1291": "The mortgage loan is the biggest commitment of your life. Improper planning of equity can drag you into supplementary loans at very high interest rates that will burden your monthly payments. An experienced mortgage advisor knows how to build a smart mix, find creative solutions for equity completion (such as bridge loans or mortgaging parents' existing property with due caution), and negotiate with banks to maximize your financing terms.",
  "new_p_1294": "A mortgage is not a single loan, but a combination of several different tracks. The right choice of portfolio is the most important financial decision you'll make in the process – even more than the interest rate level.",
  "new_p_1296": "When we approach the mortgage consulting process, the first and most important concept that comes to the table is the \"mortgage portfolio\". Many tend to think that a mortgage is one large loan, but in practice, it's a reverse investment portfolio composed of several small loans (tracks), each with different characteristics: interest type, indexation type, duration, and exit points.",
  "new_p_1297": "Building the right portfolio is an art that combines risk management with opportunity utilization. An optimal portfolio is not just one that presents the lowest monthly payment today, but one that will maintain stability over the years, allow flexibility for future changes, and save you unnecessary interest and indexation payments in the long term.",
  "new_p_1298": "The bank, as a business entity, will usually offer a portfolio that is profitable for them or one that looks attractive at first glance but is exposed to risks. Our role in mortgage consulting is to build for you the portfolio that serves only your interests.",
  "new_p_1301": "Like in an investment portfolio, you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. A proper portfolio combines indexed tracks with non-indexed tracks, and variable rates with fixed rates, to protect you from extreme market fluctuations.",
  "new_p_1303": "Do you anticipate receiving a sum of money in the future (like a training fund)? A smart portfolio will incorporate \"exit points\" and tracks without early repayment fees, allowing you to reduce the debt without unnecessary penalties.",
  "new_p_1305": "The monthly payment should be tailored to your available income today and in the future. We consider expected changes like family expansion or salary increases, and adjust the amortization schedule (spitzer or equal principal) accordingly.",
  "new_p_1307": "In the mortgage world, there's no \"magic solution\" that fits everyone. What's good for your friends might be a financial disaster for you. When we provide mortgage consulting for first-time buyers or those upgrading their housing, we examine several strategies:",
  "new_p_1311": "Important to remember: An overly aggressive portfolio based on variable rates may seem cheap today, but could lead to a sharp jump in monthly payments in a few years.",
  "new_p_1313": "Mortgage clerks at banks are professionals, but they are subject to the bank's targets and policies. Often, they will offer the bank's standard portfolio (for example, division into thirds) that is easy for them to sell and profitable for the bank.",
  "new_p_1314": "Private and objective mortgage consulting changes the picture. We come to negotiations with the bank with a ready and pre-calculated portfolio, tailored exactly to your needs. We know exactly where pressure can be applied to lower interest rates and which track to focus on. The difference between a generic portfolio and a personally tailored one can amount to savings of tens or even hundreds of thousands of shekels over the life of the mortgage.",
  "new_p_1315": "Additionally, an experienced consultant sees the full picture: they take into account the construction input index (if you purchased from a contractor), associated insurance costs, and the family's future financial plans.",
  "new_p_1317": "Don't leave the biggest financial decision of your life to chance. Contact us today for a consultation meeting without obligation, and together we'll build a mortgage that fits your needs perfectly.",
  "new_p_1354": "Spitzer, equal principal, or bullet? Understanding the numbers behind your mortgage and how choosing the right amortization schedule affects your wallet for years to come.",
  "new_p_1357": "When we approach taking out a mortgage, most of our attention is usually focused on selecting the tracks (prime, fixed, variable) and the interest rate level. However, there is another critical component that dramatically affects the monthly payment and the total interest we'll pay to the bank in the end – this is the amortization schedule. As part of professional mortgage consulting, we place great emphasis on matching the loan repayment method to the family's financial capabilities, not only in the present but also in the future.",
  "new_p_1358": "An amortization schedule is essentially the table that defines how much we'll pay each month toward the principal (the amount we borrowed) and how much toward interest. Understanding this mechanism is vital for anyone planning first-time home buyer mortgage consultation or considering refinancing, as the choice between a Spitzer schedule and equal principal can change the repayment picture by thousands of shekels.",
  "new_p_1360": "The Spitzer schedule is the most common repayment method in Israel and the Western world. The guiding principle of this method is that the monthly payment (before indexation and interest rate changes) remains fixed throughout the entire life of the loan.",
  "new_p_1361": "How does it work? At the beginning, the lion's share of the monthly payment consists of interest payment, and only a small portion reduces the principal. As time passes, the ratio reverses: the interest component decreases and the principal component increases. This is an excellent solution for young couples seeking stability in cash flow.",
  "new_p_1365": "In the \"equal principal\" method, the amount that reduces the principal (the original debt) is fixed in each payment. Interest is calculated on the remaining debt balance which keeps decreasing, so the total monthly payment starts high and decreases steadily over the years.",
  "new_p_1366": "This method is particularly suitable in the context of mortgage consultation for home upgraders or people with high current repayment capacity who want to save on total interest payments over the life of the loan. The interest savings can reach tens of thousands of shekels compared to the Spitzer schedule.",
  "new_p_1371": "Suitable for most borrowers, especially young couples in the process of purchasing their first home who need a low initial monthly payment to meet the repayment ratio required by the bank.",
  "new_p_1372": "The bottom line: stability and convenience in cash flow.",
  "new_p_1374": "Suitable for those with high and available income, or older people who want to finish the mortgage as quickly as possible and pay minimum interest to the bank.",
  "new_p_1375": "The bottom line: maximum interest savings.",
  "new_p_1377": "In this method, you pay only interest (or nothing) for a defined period, and the principal at the end. Suitable as a bridging solution, for example for home upgraders waiting to sell their old property.",
  "new_p_1378": "The bottom line: excellent temporary solution.",
  "new_p_1380": "Important to remember: The term \"fixed payment\" in the Spitzer schedule is only accurate as long as the interest rate doesn't change and the principal isn't linked to an index. In index-linked tracks, the principal balance is updated monthly according to changes in the Consumer Price Index. When the principal increases, both the interest calculation and the monthly payment are updated upward.",
  "new_p_1381": "In the process of mortgage refinancing and improving terms, we examine not only the interest rates but also the linkage composition and the amortization schedule. Sometimes, switching from a Spitzer schedule to Equal Principal (if cash flow allows) can provide better protection against inflation, as the principal erodes faster.",
  "new_p_1383": "Don't just look at the first payment! Ask the advisor or bank for a simulation showing the development of the monthly payment under realistic inflation assumptions. What seems cheap today could prove very expensive in 5 years.",
  "new_p_1385": "Building the right mortgage mix requires broad vision and deep understanding of the numbers. We're here to help you save tens of thousands of shekels and tailor the mortgage exactly to your needs.",

  "new_li_1135": "Prime interest rate: A variable interest rate that changes according to Bank of Israel decisions and is not linked to the Consumer Price Index.",
  "new_li_1136": "Consumer Price Index: An index that reflects inflation. Index-linked tracks may start with low repayments but increase over the years.",
  "new_li_1137": "Fixed interest rate: A track where the interest rate is known in advance for the entire loan period, providing certainty but sometimes at a higher initial interest rate.",
  "new_li_1170": "Interest rate decline in the economy: If today's interest rates are significantly lower than those when you took the mortgage, you can reduce the monthly payment or shorten the loan period.",
  "new_li_1171": "Improvement in financial situation: If your income has increased, or training funds have been released, you can increase the monthly payment and shorten the years, which will save many interest payments.",
  "new_li_1172": "Difficulty with monthly payment: If the monthly payment is burdening you, you can restructure the mortgage and reduce the monthly payment to ease current cash flow.",
  "new_li_1194": "Negative credit history (BDI): bounced checks, debt collection, or account restrictions in the past.",
  "new_li_1195": "High repayment ratio: when the expected monthly repayment exceeds 35%-40% of net available income.",
  "new_li_1196": "Property issues: properties with problematic land registry records or significant building violations.",
  "new_li_1230": "✓ Using a \"balloon mortgage\" or \"grace\" to pay the contractor without burdening current monthly cash flow.",
  "new_li_1231": "✓ Building a flexible mortgage mix that allows withdrawing funds in stages according to construction progress.",
  "new_li_1232": "✓ Accurate comparison between expected index cost and bank financing cost.",
  "new_li_1283": "• Savings and liquid assets: checking accounts, bank deposits, investment portfolios.",
  "new_li_1284": "• Training funds: Sometimes these funds can be used, or you can take a cheap loan against them without liquidating them.",
  "new_li_1285": "• Family assistance: gifts or loans from parents are a very common source for completing the down payment.",
  "new_li_1308": "The Stable Portfolio: Emphasis on fixed, non-indexed interest rate tracks. Suitable for those who fear changes in the index and interest rates and prefer a fixed and known monthly payment in advance, even if it's slightly higher initially.",
  "new_li_1309": "The Balanced Portfolio: A classic combination of prime track (flexible and relatively cheap), fixed non-indexed track (for stability), and variable track (for future flexibility). This is the most common portfolio that balances risk and opportunity.",
  "new_li_1310": "Short-term Portfolio: Suitable for borrowers with high repayment capacity who want to finish the mortgage quickly (10-15 years) and save hundreds of thousands of shekels in interest payments.",
  "new_li_1362": "Advantage: Relatively low initial monthly payment allowing compliance with proper payment ratio.",
  "new_li_1363": "Disadvantage: Slow debt repayment rate in the early years (\"eating the interest\").",
  "new_li_1367": "Advantage: Lower total interest payment and faster debt repayment rate.",
